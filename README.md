# C - printf

In this project, we will create a printf function. Whith :

    write, malloc, free, va_start, va_end, va_copy, va_arg.

## Test ‚úîÔ∏è

‚Ä¢ tests: Folder of test files. Provided by Holberton School.

## Header File üìÅ

‚Ä¢ main.h: Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions written in the project.

holbertonschool-printf

function that produces output according to a format.

‚Ä¢ Prototype : int _printf(const char *format, ...);

‚Ä¢ Returns : the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)

‚Ä¢ write output to stdout, the standard output stream

‚Ä¢ format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:

‚Ä¢ c

‚Ä¢ s

‚Ä¢ %

‚Ä¢ You don‚Äôt have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function

‚Ä¢ You don‚Äôt have to handle the flag characters

‚Ä¢ You don‚Äôt have to handle field width

‚Ä¢ You don‚Äôt have to handle precision

‚Ä¢ You don‚Äôt have to handle the length modifiers

**1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't**

holbertonschool-printf

Handle the following conversion specifiers:

‚Ä¢ d

‚Ä¢ i

‚Ä¢ You don‚Äôt have to handle the flag characters

‚Ä¢ You don‚Äôt have to handle field width

‚Ä¢ You don‚Äôt have to handle precision

‚Ä¢ You don‚Äôt have to handle the length modifiers

**2. Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the gospel**

man_3_printf

Create a man page for your function.
